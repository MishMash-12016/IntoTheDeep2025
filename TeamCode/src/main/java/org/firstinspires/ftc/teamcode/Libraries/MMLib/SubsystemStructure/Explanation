Hello!
Sorry for this package, it's existence might be confusing.
The main point was to try and make more specific and effective commands on categorized subsystems,
and try to get more than just "SubsystemBase" type which has no information about the inputted subsystem.
Obviously due to lack of time and honestly creativity, I couldn't really get this idea to life.
BUT! if you feel like this might be useful, you're welcome to take my idea forward!
(and please TELL ME!!! I would be really excited to hear that)
if not, you can ignore or delete it.

This is a more detailed explanation:

The point of these files is to make the SubsystemÂ´s structure a bit more organized and reachable.
The IMMPositionSubsystem interface and IMMPowerSubsystem interface,
are suppose to include all the subsystems that are based on power or position.
For example, elevator is a power based subsystem because it is DcMotor based,
on the other hand, an extender or elbow subsystems are based on position - the servo position.
Power based subsystems have the setPower method,
and position based have the setPosition method, which they override after inheriting from the abstract class.
There are also subsystems that are using both power and position,
(those should probably be separated into 2 different subsystems for the requirements, see Lifter in CENTERSTAGE 2023-24 repo)
and therefore there is also a MMPowerPositionSubsystem which have both setPower and setPosition.
You can see examples of what I tried to do in MMToggleCommand2 and ShooterTestAlsoAnExampleOnMMToggleCommand (longest name ever).
